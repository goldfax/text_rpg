The world of mageia is one where wizards live in harmony with the world around them. The only trouble with this is that there are dark wizards that wish to take over the world, and enslave those that the good wizards wish to
protect. Start the game as a wizard of a novice like abilities, grow stronger the longer that you play, and also level up your spells as you get older. The game flows in real time so one year gone by IRL, is one year in game. You can start your character at any age. It is suggested to start your character at around 20 years old so you will start out with a standard set of semi powerful spells. Sometimes genius wizards are born, you just might get that lucky draw. In any case, the point of the game is to grow old and powerful, and kill those dreadfully tacky dark wizards.
